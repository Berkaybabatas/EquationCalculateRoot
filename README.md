# EquationCalculateRoot
Java program that calculates the root of quadratic equations with the help of discriminant using Java AWT software

Discriminant Δ formula used is as follows:

ax2 + bx + c = 0 discriminant of the equation is calculated by Δ = b2– 4ac

This java program calculates delta by using the coefficients a, b and c of the quadratic equation and provides an 
easy use by creating a graphical user interface (GUI) using the java AWT library.
